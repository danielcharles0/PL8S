%if needed write here other details about your Data Logic Layer that cannot be expressed directly through the ER schema

All the entities id's have been chosen to be of type SERIAL for performance reasons, since a JOIN clause performed with an INT value is faster than when performed with a VARCHAR value.\\
The Dish's attribute \textit{price} must be strictly positive, a direct consequence is that also Order's \textit{price} must be strictly positive.\\
The Dish's attribute \textit{isDeleted} is set to 0 by default. The dishes can be only softly deleted for guaranteeing an order history to the customer. Instead, if we delete a user, the deletion of the associated orders is guaranteed to avoid foreign key errors. \\
The \textit{quantity} attribute in the relation between Dish and Order expresses the quantity of each dish in an order, its value must be a strictly positive integer, the default value is set to 1.\\
The \textit{stripe\_id} in the user entity is generated within the Stripe's context and it is necessary for performing a payment.
