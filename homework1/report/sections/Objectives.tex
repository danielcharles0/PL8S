The primary objective of our web application, named PL8S, is to simplify the food ordering process at festivals by providing a user-friendly platform that eliminates the need for long queues at the counter. This web service is designed to let users autonomously compile their order, similar to the touch-screen ordering systems found in popular fast-food chains, but with the added convenience of being accessible directly from the user's device.

The application allows customers to place orders at multiple restaurants through a unified interface that can be easily accessed from home or on-site, thereby making the food ordering process more efficient and accessible.
